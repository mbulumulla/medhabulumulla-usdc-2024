# Design Journey

## Overall Process & Decision making

- first used a forEach loop but performs better with for loop
- assumption that a word does not contain numerical charectors
- problem with empty spaces or text that isn't a string

## Testing and Iteration


### Writing Test Strategy

### Most proud component

### Most difficult component
- lines are not the same as a sentence


### Edge cases

*those addressed and those you might address if given more time*
